# EventHopper Application Code

This is the code for the 'Hopper' application. It is built with the guidance of Simon Holme's book [Getting MEAN](https://www.manning.com/books/getting-mean-with-mongo-express-angular-and-node).

## Get the code

To get the code:

`$ git clone https://github.com/terabytes/hopper.git`

Then change into the folder the git clone command will create:

`$ cd hopper`

And finally install the dependencies:

`npm install`

## To run the application
Make sure you have the following:
- [Node](http://nodejs.org/download/)
- [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)
- Git
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) (formerly Heroku Toolbelt)

Please note that the book refers to using Heroku Foreman - that's obsolete. See [this](https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/692) article. If you're using a Windows machine and want to use git as you would on a UNIX machine, I recommend installing [GitBash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).
